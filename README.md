# Assignment 4
## GAM531 - Game Engine Foundations

I have used the **OpenTK** library since the goal of the assignment 1 was to render a 2D rectangle in an OpenGL Window, which can only be done using this library. The SharpDX library is used to work with DirectX.

## Operations implemented

### 1. Matrix Operations
- Implemented `Rotation` and `Scaling` to a cube
- See Game Window for results

### 2. Texture Applied to the cube
- A Wall texture had been applied to each face of the cube

## How to run the project

NOTE: Windows is needed to run this program.

1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Divyesh-Bhanvadiya/GAM531-Assignment-2.git
```
2. Open in the IDE of your choice and install `OpenTK (4.9.4)` and `System.Drawing.Common (9.0.9)` as dependencies.
3. Place the `wall.jpg` image from the Assets folder into this directory.
```
[Your-Project-Directory]\bin\Debug\net8.0\Assets
```
4. Build and run the project.
5. Check game window for results.
